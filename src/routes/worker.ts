 * POST /api/worker/reviewed — the background import worker reports an AI-review
 * checkpoint: "structured" after the fast Jev pass (structured health fields
 * already written, cleanup pending) or "reviewed"/"error" terminal states.
 * `newOptions: true` also republishes the categories (the cleanup model created
 * options). The API process owns the WebSocket clients, so it re-reads and
 * publishes the changed collections here. The worker process cannot do that
 * directly because its in-memory realtime hub has no browser connections.
 *
 * Auth: shared secret, `Authorization: Bearer <WORKER_SECRET>`. Fail closed:
 * a missing or wrong secret (or none configured) is always 401.
