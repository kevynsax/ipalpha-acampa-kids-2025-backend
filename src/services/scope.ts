/**
 * Data scope of a session — the ONE place that decides what a non-admin may
 * read. Every read path (REST lists/details and the realtime snapshot) filters
 * through here, so the frontend never receives what it must not show.
 *
 *   admin        → everything
 *   staff /      → only their own room. A CARETAKER (staff.roomRole) gets the
 *   health_staff   kids under THEIR care (Camper.caretakerId) any time, and the
 *                  other kids of the room only WHILE THE CAMP IS HAPPENING
 *                  (see services/camp.ts); a HELPER gets the room's kids only
 *                  during the camp. Both as "care" records: health, notes,
 *                  preferences and the guardian's NAME + PHONE (so they can
 *                  reach the parents), but NO emergency contact, documents,
 *                  insurance or e-mail (that stays with the admin, the medical
 *                  team and the check-in helpers). Plus their own staff record
 *                  and the NAME + PHONE + room role + TEAM of the colleagues
 *                  in the same room.
 *                  The programme: every event, but only the roles that apply
 *                  to THEM (see scopeEvent) — never who does what elsewhere.
 *   check-in     → a staff member the admin listed as a check-in helper, WHILE
 *   helper         the check-in window is open: additionally every camper
 *                  (full record, health included — they confirm it with the
 *                  parents) and every bedroom. Other staff stay invisible.
 *                  The moment the window closes the extra data stops being
 *                  sent (snapshot, updates and REST alike).
 *   bus helper   → same window, for the bus roll call. The admin links the
 *                  helper to ONE vehicle (Settings → busHelpers, independent
 *                  from staff.transportation: they stand at the DOOR of that
 *                  vehicle, they need not ride in it). They get the campers of
 *                  THAT vehicle as NAME-ONLY records (name, age, room, team,
 *                  check-in stamps) — never health, contacts or notes — plus
 *                  every bedroom (for the labels). Kids in their own room stay
 *                  full (they look after them).
 *   organizer    → a staff member the admin listed as an ORGANIZER (no time
 *                  window): the ADMIN'S data scope (`all: true`) — every
 *                  camper, staff member, bedroom and the whole programme —
 *                  and the admin's writes, EXCEPT the four admin-only areas:
 *                  the organizers list itself, categories, notifications and
 *                  the "about" page (`admin: false`). Occurrences: only the
 *                  ones the organizers themselves registered (the admin sees all).
 *   game         → a staff member the admin listed as a GAME organizer (no
 *   organizer      window): writes the programme (events, roles, assignments)
 *                  and the scoreboard (Placar): give / take / zero points of
 *                  any team. Sees every staff member in FULL and the whole
 *                  programme. NOT an organizer: campers / bedrooms as any team
 *                  member, no settings.
 *   score helper → a staff member the admin listed as a SCORE helper (no
 *                  window): ONLY the bulk QR scan tied to a programme event
 *                  (the kid's team gets the event's points). Never gives /
 *                  takes points by team, never zeroes, deletes only their
 *                  own scan lines, no organizer rights. Every camper reaches
 *                  them as a "name" record (name + team) so the scan can be
 *                  resolved and shown. Everything else: as any team member.
 *   medical      → a staff member the admin listed as MEDICAL team (no time
 *                  window): every camper in FULL (health included), every
 *                  bedroom — hence every vehicle — the whole time. They may
 *                  edit the kids' HEALTH block (PUT /api/campers/:id/health),
 *                  never rooms or check-ins. Occurrences: only the ones the
 *                  medical team registered. Staff / programme: as any team
 *                  member.
 *   vest helper  → a staff member the admin listed as a VEST (colete) helper,
 *                  until VEST_GRACE_DAYS after the camp ends (they collect the
 *                  vests back in the days after): every staff member as NAME + PHONE +
 *                  vest status ("contact" visibility) — never health, room,
 *                  team or check-in — and may stamp the vest delivery /
 *                  return. Everything else: as any team member.
  *   photographer → a staff member the admin listed as a PHOTOGRAPHER (no
 *   window): uploads the camp's photos (POST /api/gallery), edits and
 *   publishes them, and sees the drafts on the Fotos tab. Everything else:
 *   as any team member.
*   parent       → their OWN kids (matched by the guardian phone), in full,
 *                  and the kids' rooms. The "important contacts"
 *                  (Settings → Contatos) as NAME + PHONE records the WHOLE
 *                  time the parent may use the app (their access window —
 *                  they are the numbers to call when something happens).
 *                  WHILE THE PARENTS' WINDOW is open (from the kids' check-in
 *                  start to the end of the last event — see
 *                  services/camp.ts#parentWindow) additionally the team
 *                  members of their kids' rooms, same NAME + PHONE shape.
 *                  Outside it: the contacts only. The programme: events
 *                  marked visible to parents, without roles or assignments.
 *                  They may edit their kid's health block
 *                  (PUT /api/campers/:id/parent).
 *
 * ORDINARY team members (on none of the lists above, nor a parent contact)
 * are further gated by `settings.staffAccessWindow`: outside it they get
 * NO_ACCESS. `settings.checkinTestMode` makes the check-in window count as
 * open for the church / bus helpers (testing before the real day).
